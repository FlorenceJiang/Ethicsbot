0,"Am I the asshole for not wanting my husband to set his morning alarm on the Google home because it forces me awake 3 hours early? Recently my husband has started setting his morning alarm on the Google home instead of his phone. His phone alarm does not wake me up the Google home does. Not only does it wake me up but he often spends a good minute trying to turn it off, (""Hey Google...hey Google! HEY GOOGLE!"") The alarm also jolts me awake and I cant go back to sleep.  He claims that he always puts his phone alarm on snooze and is often late for work and that setting the alarm on Google is the only thing that properly wakes him up.  However I go to bed later than he does and start work later in the day. Because of this new habit I'm losing 3 hours of sleep every morning and have been groggy at work.   He claims he needs to have it this way, meanwhile I think it's pretty inconsiderate.",175,not the asshole. You shouldn't be sleep deprived because he lacks the self control to get up to his phone alarm.,2
1,"Am I the asshole for not wanting a mutual acquaintance to be a bridesmaid and let my fiance tell her no? Going to apologize for the formatting... Everything happened so fast, and I'm still a bit shaken up... This was Future Dear Husband's idea to post it...  So I'm engaged to my FDH, and both of us have this.... Mutual ""Friend"" if you call it... Let's call her Carmen. Now, DFH and Carmen new each other since middle school, and I knew her since high school. Seems all good right....? Well... When I first met FDH in my senior year of high school, the first words out of my mouth is, doesn't Carmen like you? For a bit of background, Carmen was diagnosed as borderline psyco. And has ALWAYS had a massive crush on FDH. Like, crazy crush... Going as far as to create FAKE phone numbers and spam social media accounts to text him whenever he blocked her. So after announcing we were dating to our friends, she tried everything in her power to get us to break up. From texting me saying that they sent inappropriate things to each other, (Which was a lie) to Trying to convince FDH that I was a sociopath, when all I ever did was be the shoulder for her to cry on... In total, she tried to break us up at LEAST 5 times. After Everytime, she apologizes and said that she didn't know what came over her. With backstory out of the way, I always see the good I'm everyone, but at this particular time, she had used a fake account by the alias of Alissa to text him. (Keep in mind that this was the 15th fake account she's used on him). He automatically knew it was her and told me about it. I got upset, but decided, since I was her friend, I'd let it slide. Well, 3 days after that incident, she starts asking me about the wedding party line up. Asking, ""So. You know about the maid of honor?"" And when I said that I haven't decided yet, she slyly mentioned that since we were real close she thought she'd be an Excellent candidate. If you read any of my other posts, you would know I suffer from anxiety and rejecting people is not exactly my strong suit. I told her, ""I don't know yet. And I really don't wanna talk about it."" A couple of days later, she sent me a message, ""so! Whatchya doing?????"" And I responded with something vague, ""looking at dresses"" to which she automatically jumped to the conclusion that I was wedding dress shopping. Her response, ""WHY AM I NOT THERE WITH YOU?!?!"" If course get extremely uncomfortable and end up showing FDH. His response was basically, ""She's just trying to get close to me. I'll deal with her."" So within a week, he broke the news to her that HE didn't want her in the wedding, and she started texting me, accusing ME of targeting her and leading her on, when I tried not to.... I've asked friends about it and they said that she shouldn't have tried to invite herself to the wedding, let alone be a bridesmaid/MOH.... But I still feel bad... Please let me know....  Am I the asshole....?",551,INFO I'm so genuinely confused how and why this person is still in either or yours lives ? Is she that hard to cut off? I get being friends for a long time but at this point she sounds awful. I have a sister with a severe borderline mental issue and that's no excuse to act that way.,2
2,"Would I be the asshole to ask friends to pitch in for an engagement party? I recently got engaged and was looking at putting together an engagement party amongst our friends to celebrate. My fiancé and I were planning on taking care of all the costs of throwing the party, but several of my coworkers and relatives are saying that an engagement party is something that other people throw for you. I wouldn’t feel comfortable assuming our friends would pay for the whole thing (especially if they didn’t offer to throw the party initially), but would it be an a-hole move to ask them to pitch in (e.g bring things to the party like food, drinks, snacks, etc.)?",118,"no assholes here - Food and drinks seems fine to request, but nothing like venue or anything if they haven't already offered.",1
3,"Am I the asshole for still wanting to use the baby names we picked out, despite having a ""miscarriage""? My husband and I have been trying for a baby for just a few months and we are happily expecting, due at the in late early fall. When we started trying we discussed names and I had two (one for a boy, and one for a girl) that I felt very strongly about that he likes and said we could use if he gets to pick the middle name. I am completely satisfied with this compromise. Before we got pregnant with this little one I began experiencing some pregnancy symptoms and my period was late and I took a test that was a very faint positive. I also had a faint positive with this kiddo when I took a test about a week after I missed my period. I shared the news with my husband but it was too early to book an appointment with my OB because she usually does not see patients until they're at least 9 weeks. 2ish weeks later, maybe less, I had some cramping and had what felt like a very bad period. My doctor told me I could have had a false positive or a chemical pregnancy which is when the embryo fails to implant or the pregnancy otherwise fails before it is detectable. I haven't had many strong emotions towards it other than that sucks. I didn't feel like I was truly pregnant like I am now and had not had time to get very attached to the pregnancy, if I was every pregnant at all. My husband was pretty distraught and I have tried to be there for him as much as I can. I am probably an AH because part of me has been a little frustrated that he's more upset than me especially when we don't even know if I was actually pregnant but I have still listened to him and suggested he see a therapist if he wants to.   Here's where the issue is though. Now my husband does not want to use the names we agreed to because he feels they both belong to the ""baby"" I miscarried. I got a little annoyed and told him it wasn't a baby, and it's fine for him to feel sad about the loss of potential but it still wasn't a baby and we can't be sure a baby would have existed at all. He thinks I am being heartless towards the ""child we lost"". He wants us to pick out fresh names but I don't, I have been attached to these names for a long time and had always hoped I would be able to use them for a real living child. I used to name my dolls these names when I was a kid so I have been dreaming of using them for over 20 years. I don't want to hurt his feelings more but I feel like he's ascribing way too much emotion over what was possibly 2-4 cells of matter that didn't take, again, if it existed at all! I could have been late due to stress at the time! Am I the asshole for wanting to use the names we'd already agreed to for our baby?",549,"Crying from disappointment I could get, but he's acting like he lost an actual child, which in this context I just don't understand.",2
4,"Would I be the asshole for not attending my nans funeral due to starting a new job? So, recently my nan passed away and her funeral has been planned for what is supposed to be my 3rd day at my new job. I have spoken to my superiors and they have said that it is vital I attend the first week due to inductions, training, health and safety etc. and have expressed very clearly that they don't want me to have the time off (although they will permit it begrudgingly).   This job is literally my dream job, something I have worked very hard towards in the last 5 years studying at uni.   Would I be the asshole if I missed the funeral in favour of my new job?",128,"If a job told me I wasn't allowed to go to a family member's funeral, I would tell them it wasn't a job I wanted.

5,"Am I the asshole for not getting my girlfriend a big gift for her Bday? Pretty simple. I started dating this girl, Amanda. She's pretty cool. A month and 5 dates so far, and we've only been exclusive for a week. Nothing much.   Yesterday was her birthday. I just got her a bouquet of candy. She did look lile she was disappointed with her gift. Later her friends called me an asshole for not getting her a bigger present and that she's lying when she says she's fine.   So, Am I the asshole?",93,not the asshole. Your gift is appropriate for the very short amount of time you have been together.,2
6,"Am I the asshole for being mad at my gf for getting mad at me for not disclosing my herpes to her before sex when she already had it and has never disclosed hers to any sex partners? This is not my normal account because I don’t want to put this on my normal account.  Ok. Me and my girlfriend had sex a bunch of times before I told her I have herpes (genital HSV 1.) She was very mad at me. I was very sorry and apologetic. I felt bad because I knew it was not good I did that. She forgave me. I was relieved.  That was several months ago. Flash forward to last week. She gets a cold sore. (oral HSV 1.) She tells me she’s gotten cold sores for years, since college. I asked why she was so mad at me for “exposing” her to a virus she already has, and asked her why she didn’t disclose it to me before going down on me before I disclosed to her that I have the same virus. She laughed and said it’s totally not necessary and that I make no sense.  When I asked her if she ever had disclosed it to past partners, she got all confused and said of course not. Ok....so she exposed her past partners to genital herpes bunches of times and acted like that was no big deal!  Now I’m mad that she was so mad at me.   Am I the asshole here?",251,"everybody sucks here for not disclosing if you both knew your status in advance.   &gt;I asked why she was so mad at me for “exposing” her to a virus she already has  Herpes infection is area-localized, meaning you may have it in your genitals, but not in your mouth, and therefore will only transmit it genitally.   She may have had the oral version before but now she also has the genital version. Don't minimize the fact that she's upset about this, you didn't disclose your genital HSV and that's asshole behavior. At the same time, she should have told you that she had oral HSV.",0
7,"Am I the asshole for wanting a friends help So I'm trans(21) and currently going through a really bad patch of depression, it's been going on for several months now and just keeps getting worse. I struggled to talk to friends as I was afraid I'd spread my unhappiness (the few times I was in small groups with them I was described as ""soul sucking"" and ""miserable"") or that I'd end up giving in and asking them to help (which would just be hearing me moan about my problems), and I refuse to be a burden or responsibility for anyone. Several friends started ignoring me because of this. Only one close friend remained who realised that I wasn't doing great, mostly because she lived with me at the time and found out about my attempted suicide during all this. Jump on a month or so to me telling my family and having them tell me they'd never accept this and being forced to live with them for the next 9 months due to college reasons. This made everything just spiral downwards until I gave in and messaged my remaining friend tell her about my suicidal thoughts. She said she'd call me, but after not hearing from her for several days afterwards that made things worse. I then left a Facebook group she was in because she was constantly online chatting to 2 other people we know and it just made me feel worse and more hated. After I left she told me she was going to contact my younger sister and she told her to be worried about me, even though I told her telling my family anything about this would only make everything more difficult. Jump forward another 4 days and she hasn't talked to me since. So my question is, aita for trying to rely on a friend when I had a problem like this? Was that selfish of me? TL;DR I asked a friend for help when I maybe shouldn't have, while in a difficult situation and she is no longer talking to me",347,"It wasn't selfish of you (in fact, it was brave) to reach out to friends and ask for help when you needed it.  With that said, most people are not equipped to deal with the despair of others.  Most people will listen in the early stages of a friend reaching out for help, but when their listening/advice don't seem to help, they tend to create distance.  It is a lot to feel responsible for someone else's mental health.  You need to get the help you need.  If you cannot rely on friends for that help, you need to look elsewhere.  Call a suicide hotline.  Talk to a therapist.  Do not use the unreliability of friends in this situation to feed further negative thoughts about yourself.  You need professional help.  Please seek it.  Not the asshole.",3
8,"Am I the asshole for kicking people off the debate team So this year I became president of my school's debate team. And I know, it may sound like I'm taking high school debate a bit too seriously. Still, debate is my passion, and I'd like to see my team go far. However, only four people got to state, and only one person, yours truly, was able to make it to nationals last year, which really irritated me. Our debate team had a couple issues:  1. As an asian myself, I can safely say debate is one of the extracurricular activities 90% of asian parents push their kids into, whether they like debate or not. So half of our team is kids who like debate and want to compete. Some kids were forced by their parents, but still take debate seriously and want to compete. The rest of the kids are either a) just terrible debaters or b) kids who blow off debate and don't show up to meetings   2. Our debate team didn't get as much funding as compared to stuff like sports or theatre, which is frustrating. We didn't even have a debate coach. Thos is because our school isn't that good at debate. Out of a team of over a 100 people (if you're wondering, the school has about 2500) 4 people made it to state and 1 made it to nationals. That's not enough to get good funding.  3. Caps. Our team had a system in place where after 4 tournaments, you have to sit out the rest if tournaments for the year. So all the kids who are good at debate have to sit it out, and the kids who don't give a fuck about debate or those who are terrible at debate are forced to sign up for the tournament (because the school needs to fill a certain amount of slots). Then the school gets thrashed.   So I was elected captain at the beginning of the year. My goal is pretty simple: we need to go further, win more, become good enough at debate so that the school increases our funding. The hard part is getting there.   In the meantime, to become the best we can, I decided I needed to start asking for membership fees. Normally debate is free, but we needed to pool money for a coach. I went to the school and asked them permission to collect fees and do fundraisers and stuff. Since the principal likes me, I got the go-ahead. I started collecting a fee of $75 per person, and told people to see me if they couldn't financially afford it. Next, we did a few fundraisers: everybody brought in stuff they didn't need anymore and we did a yard sale/raffle. We threw a pool party with a $5 entry fee. Finally, we started a GoFundMe page and got our school to put it on their Facebook/Twitter.   We finally had enough money to hire a good coach, and we did.  Next thing I did (I had the authority to do this, being captain) was remove the caps. My belief is that if you want to go to tournaments, you have to be the best. I arranged what I call tournament qualifiers: the kids in each categories would face off in rounds against each other, and the highest 5 in each category would go.   Lastly, and most controversially, I kicked a lot of kids off the team. Debate so far has been a club where anybody could join, but I made it into a 'by try-out only' kind of club. There isn't actually a tryout, but it is similar: if you miss 5 meetings (there are 3 meetings a week), you're out. If you're falling behind (ranking badly in 2 qualifying tournaments in a row), I'll give you extra one-on-one time with the coach to improve. By the next qualifying tournament, if you don't do well, you're out.  My reasoning behind this is simple: it's a really large team, and we only can afford to hire one good coach. The coach has to spend time with 113 different people, and many of these people just aren't improving or just don't care The more people on the team, the less time he has to focus on each individual, their strengths, their flaws, and how they can improve. If we kick out the kids that aren't improving, the coach will stop wasting his time and help those who can and want to be helped.   Some people are calling me an asshole, but I think my policy is tough but fair. If you're falling behind, I'll give you one-on-one time with the coach. If you improve, great! If not, you'll just be wasting the team's time. ",793,"INFO. (I'll change it after a little discussion)  First, congrats on doing so well in your debate competitions. It's also an impressive feat to structure such a large extracurricular and even manage to hire a coach.  From my high school experience, clubs like debate are there for students who enjoy a particular activity and want to explore it more. Sure there are competitions, but the goal should be to allow students to try something new and possibly learn and have fun while at it. Your drive to compete well at competitions is very admirable, but I fail to see why you need the rest of your team to also place well. Am I missing something? Does you're entire team need to have a certain placement overall for you to advance?  In other words, imagine a student who wishes to learn more about public speaking but is intimidated by the notion that debate is only for ""gifted"" students. The best thing a high school debate club can do for this student is to encourage him to participate, rather than shut him out.  It seems you have a great understanding  of what needs to be done to succeed in competition, but I think you're taking the club side of high school debate a little too seriously. My advice would be to maybe create a competitive division for your debate team, where only the students who are really serious about competition would join. The club team can be there for those who may not be interested in competition.",3

10,"Am I the asshole for getting pissed at my neighors for being scared of my dog? Am I the asshole:  Everyday. Everyday I see my neighbors. They live one floor below me and I see them everyday, but more importantly, my dog, Hatter, sees them everyday.   She is the friendliest, most excitable, loving dog I've ever owned. She's a medium sized dog and if you go through my profile you'll find pictures of her.  Everyday when I walk her and run into my neighbors they let out a shrill gasp, they jump away, they act like she's a monster who just said ""Boo"". Just this morning the mother gasped, threw herself out of our path and cowarded. Like with her hands over her head..One morning the father of a special needs child saw my dog coming down the stairs, leashed I may add,  grabbed his daughter and threw her against a wall out of our path. Legit, hard enough that it hurt her.  S not even afraid of dogs! Everytime we see the child with her (nanny/grandmother?) She claps with delight and pets Hat.  Look, I understand not liking dogs or even being scared of dogs, but this behavior is ridiculous and it serioisly pisses me off. I've lived here for months, I say she's friendly Every fucking time you act scared. She's never once barked at you or your family, or really ever since we've moved in. She's never lunged at you or made a move. She walks down the stairs and flicks her old ear at you and if you were interested in petting her she wouldn't say no, she'd even throw in a few face licks.   Their reaction just pisses me off and it basically ruins our whole walk. If you're scared of dogs, whatever, but don't fucking inflict that fear on your child. Don't act like I've just appeared before you in a puff of smoke laughing manically. I'm a girl and her dog, trying to take a walk.  ",333,"Not the asshole for being angry.

Context: we're both freshmen, second semester  At the start of the school year she went out a few times during orientation week with her friends and then was going out on the weekends.

Earlier this week I found out via her group chat with friends (she left her Instragram logged in on my phone) that they've been keeping alcohol in the dorm. I confronted her about it and she confirmed that she's been drinking pretty much every weekend since September without telling me.  I want her to completely stop, at least for a while, both because she lied to me and because I'm still not comfortable with it.

16,"Am I the asshole? My Rotty bit a Bulldog in the face! So I live an Apartment complex were 65% or the residents own a dog. I love dogs and pride myself in having well behaved, trained, and socialized pets. One morning we go out so she can do her morning potty break. This particular morning one of the residents goes out to let her bulldog use the restroom. The dog is sweet but it’s obvious he has zero leash training and socializing skills. He pulls and tugs his owner around everywhere they go he jumps on and lunges at anyone walking by or close to him. I know he isn’t trying to attack anyone, he just was never taught the proper way to introduce himself to people. Anyways, my dog is doing her thing and I see the lady and the bulldog coming by. They keep their distance and she’s trying (unsuccessfully) to get her dog to calm down and go to the bathroom. This dog is trying his hardest to pull over and get to my dog.  Now keep in mind this is a Rottweiler I have. She is a family pet but she is also a protector and guardian. I have a wife and daughter that this dog is meant to protect so she is trained to watch her humans backs. The dog is yanking the owner to walk past us so I move out of the way, my dog is sitting next to me like she’s supposed to when suddenly she loses grip on the leash and her bulldog lunges at my legs! Before he reaches me my Rotty is cutting him off and bites right into his face. The bulldog cries and runs backwards. My dog doesn’t pursue, doesn’t bark or growl just stands in front of me in a protective stance. The lady apologizes and goes to her dog who is now bleeding. I feel bad for the poor guy of course because I know he just wanted to be pet, my dog on the other hand doesn’t know what that dogs intentions where. Her job is to protect and she saw a stranger dog lunge at me and did what she was supposed to. I make sure the lady and dog are ok, she goes her own way and I go mine.

17,"Am I the asshole for getting annoyed about having to give up my seat at the bus stop? Background: I attend University in a city approximately 2 hours from where I live. I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I’m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city’s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there’s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I’m also 5 months pregnant.   So, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I’m usually pretty exhausted. As it’s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn’t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She’s a little older, but I wouldn’t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says ‘You can sit here’ beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took.   My pregnancy wasn’t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I’m sitting down 😒 But it’s very obvious when I’m standing, many people ask me if I’m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby.   Anyway, I don’t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I’m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn’t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant.   I don’t know if I was just being hormonal, but Am I the asshole? Would be good to know in case this happens again. ",451,You are definitely not the asshole. A pregnant woman and the elderly deserve seats the most. You should’ve ignored her or told her you were pregnant ,2
18,"Am I the asshole For Not Wanting My Parents To Live With Me? To render a much longer story short, my mother abandoned me at birth. I was largely raised by one aunt and my grandparents with occasional bouts of my mother dropping in until I was 8. Then she got involved with my step dad and I would spend one or two weekends a month with them until  I was in 8th grade. After that I kind of lived with them in high school (I say it that way because we really didn't get along, and I was probably no picnic, but my mother was violent and I spent a lot of time not actually living there), then I moved out and joined the Army. Fast forward 25 years and I have a home and family of my own. Meanwhile for a host of reasons my parents have some serious health issues and while our relationship has improved I would not say that we're close. But, I am their only child and I have stepped in to help with things like setting up grocery delivery and a home health care aide. I have no problem contributing some money to their needs, but I draw the line at either of them living with me.   Until recently this was fine with everyone, but my step dad's health is declining pretty rapidly now, and eventually my mother will not be able to live on her own. Now the family seems to think I should be planning to move them in for hospice care for my Dad and long term living for my mom. That's not an option as far as I'm concerned.  Everyone else seems to think I owe them this because they're my parents, but functionally that's never actually been our relationship. Emotionally my parents were my aunt &amp; my grandparents. My grandparents died, and while my aunt is still alive she's busy planning her Thanksgiving trip to Barcelona so there's no reason to even think about her needing a caretaker.  from where I sit the family feels this way because none of them want to deal with my parents, but I'm definitely biased. Give it to me straight, am I the asshole here?",373,"not the asshole. You shouldn't have to take on any responsibility you're not ready for with your parents, and you certainly shouldn't have to financially burden yourself for them. Perhaps look into nursing homes or something similar.",2
19,"Am I the asshole for cleaning my son and DIL's apartment while she was in labor? (Full disclosure, my mom tried to post this and it got removed. Pretty sure because she tried to censor the word asshole? Either way, I created a throwaway to help her post it. Hope that's cool. Also, be gentle-ish - she's not a Reddit native.)  Her words:  My daughter-in-law and I have never really gotten along. She has always been cold with me and I don't know why. She's hard to get to know. But she is good to my older son and I love her for that.  I was surprised when my daughter-in-law got pregnant that she did not want either myself or her own mother present at the birth. That is not how I did things and I wanted all the support I could get from people I know and trust. Instead she hired a doula to coach her through. She said it was because a stranger would be less pressure. I didn't understand really but I accepted it. But I still wanted to support her and my son somehow.  When she was in labor, they asked me to feed their dog and cat. I was given a key. When I was in their home, I decided to deep clean the entire apartment. I scrubbed and organized. I changed their sheets. I put away all their clean clothes on the floor and washed, dried, folded, and put away the dirty clothes I found strewn about. I made sure there was no dog or cat hair on the floor. I vacuumed. The apartment was sparkling when I was done.  When they came home, they thanked me but I noticed my DIL was distant. She kept pulling away more and more over the next few weeks, even leaving the room when I would visit. She said that it was so she could get a break but I could tell she was upset or angry. I kept asking my son (her husband) and finally he told me that she thought it was ""presumptuous and controlling"" that I cleaned their house. He said he understood that I had good intentions, but he also feels like I made her feel bad.   I am flabbergasted! I just wanted to help. I didn't want a new mother to have to clean her whole house when she came home from the hospital. I thought she would be grateful. I am very hurt by her response.  My son who pointed me towards Reddit thinks I was intrusive. But he thinks other people's perspective could be interesting. I am willing to try.  Am I the asshole?",443,"Yeah, you are the asshole here. Help in the way you were asked to help, not how you want to help. You violated some serious boundaries here. My guess is this isn't the first time you've done something like this and that's why your DIL isn't crazy about you. Back off, stop invalidating their decisions with ""that's not how I would've done it"", and respect their space and parental decisions going forward. That's the only way you're going to have a better relationship with them and your grandchild in the future. ",2
20,"Am I the asshole for being angry with my fiancé’s roommates for kicking us out so they can adopt? I’m 27 years old and just moved from Canada to the US to be with my fiancé. He lives with roommates currently: a married (straight) couple who own the house, the guy’s brother, and the girl’s sister. I moved here with the idea that we would stay here a couple of months while actively looking for our own place, which we have been. We have some good leads, but haven’t gotten our own place just yet.   A week into my living here (which was maybe 4 days ago?), the girl half of the couple informs us that they are likely to adopt 3 girls in the near future. The couple has struggled with infertility, and there was previous talk about them adopting these same kids. It was kind of pulled out from under them, but all of a sudden it’s back on the table.   They’re doing a home study shortly and then finalizing everything, and they want me and my fiancé’s current bedroom (the master bedroom) to be the girls’ room. They need an empty bedroom. They want us out by Monday. This coming Monday. So they offer us the option of “staying with family or friends” (I just moved here and have zero family in the area) or staying in their basement for a few weeks.   Here’s the problem. I’m chronically ill (with an Ehlers-Danlos-like condition) and have a mild physical disability. Stairs are hard for me, but I can generally manage some of them. However, the staircase leading down to the basement has an incredibly steep stairway that is not only really difficult for me to get up and down, but I literally don’t feel safe on it. I’ve had more trouble walking than usual lately (tripping over my own feet, etc.) and it’s an accident waiting to happen. There’s no kitchen or bathroom in the basement. So it’s a situation that’s literally unlivable for me. I need to shower, I need to eat. So effectively, it’s kicking us out.   There’s very little chance we’ll find an apartment quickly enough to move on Monday.  We do have friends that offered for us to stay in their living room for a few weeks until we can get a place, but it’s an extremely uncomfortable living situation for me. I get migraines that last for days sometimes, I sometimes need to sleep in the middle of the day. I can’t work yet due to restrictions with my spousal (K1) visa, and I don’t even have a car (or know how to drive yet, I’m from a city where you don’t need to). So basically we’re looking at weeks of me being stuck in my fiancé’s friends’ living room, regardless of illness or pain. I’m not trying to be high maintenance. All I want is a space where I can live reasonably comfortably and be able to physically navigate it.   I’m honestly furious with my fiancé’s roommates. They know I have mobility issues. They gave us so little notice it would actually be illegal where I’m from. But I honestly feel like kind of an asshole for it. They’re nice people and they’ve wanted kids for years and it’s been really hard for them to not be able to have them. Maybe in their situation I would do the same thing. Am I the asshole?",573,INFO this cannot POSSIBLY be the first your fiancé is hearing about this,2
21,"Am I the asshole for accidentally choking my friend unconscious? So my buddy and I were hanging out and he is playing around and grabs a cup full of coins that I keep in my truck. He runs inside and locked the door but eventually let me in. So I am looking around trying to find it and he said it was in a cabinet (It was really in the refrigerator). So I jokingly say tell me or I'll get you in a rear-naked choke. So I grab him and he says you can't choke me out so I tightened it and like any untrained person tried to pry my forearm off. I didn't know how tight it really was until his hands fell to the side.   He was only unconscious for a few seconds and seemed fine afterwards. I am genuinely apologetic and even offer to let him choke me out and give him my back, but he didn't. He said he wasn't mad and even wanted to get food afterwards. I actually was late and had to leave and he tells me he thought he was pointing to the fridge but both his arms were on my forearm.  Fast forward to now and he hasn't texted me back once when I ask what he is doing. He doesn't respond in my friends group chat. He didn't even take my offer to buy him some alcohol (He loves old Jack Daniels). So Am I the asshole for accidentally doing that to my friend, and do you think I can repair our friendship?   TLDR: My friend was messing around and took so coins from my car. I accidentally choked him and he passed out. He never tapped out and never took his hands from my forearm. He was only out for a few seconds and seemed fine. Now he won't respond to me. Am I the asshole? ",317,"Yep. You don't mess with that shit, it's dangerous.

22,Am I the asshole for telling our family that we need time alone with our first newborn and we want the family to get the FLU shot before visiting the baby? ,31,"not the asshole. There is a thread from earlier here from the other side - someone offended that they were required to get the flu shot before seeing their friend's baby - she was determined to be the asshole for refusing to get the flu shot. This is about safety, and you have every right to protect your child. I'm immunocompromised and I readily cancel on my clients whenever they or their child in the house is sick. Mild flu symptoms for them could mean the hospital for me. Everybody that can should be getting the flu shot.  As far as visiting - it is VERY stressful to have a child, and people often do not give the mother and baby space or respect during this transition period. They should respect your boundaries and mental health. They'll get over it.",2
23,"Am I the asshole for asking for a discount? I recently hired a service to do a spring cleanup around our yard. When I called them, the owner of the company said it would be X per hour, plus cost of disposal for hauling away yard waste. This sounded reasonable, so I set up a time. They came and cleared the yard, and did a great job! It was quite a mess before and it looks much better now. It took them several hours.   Then we got the bill a few days later and it was significantly more than I expected. It turns out that the X per hour rate was X per guy per hour, and there were three guys working for most of the day.   So I called the company and said that I was upset about the bill and asked for a discount. I don't usually do this. I am definitely not usually a ""talk to the manager"" kind of a person. Usually I just pay the bill and move on, but this was such a difference from what we had anticipated, and money is pretty tight for us right now, and my wife was upset about it and encouraged me to speak up, so I made the phone call.   It was very awkward. The guy said he was insulted that I would think he would pay his employees so little (X ÷ 3). And of course I want them all to be fairly paid! But I didn't know ahead of time how many people would be coming to do the work. I would not have asked them do as much if I had known. I told the guy that he should really have made it clear that the per hour charge was also per worker. He said I should have known that it was per man hour.  Now I am feeling confused. Should I have known that? I definitely don't want to short change anyone. I generally try to support small local businesses. And I am definitely in favor of him paying his employees fairly. It was just such a shock to receive a bill so much higher than what we thought it was going to be.   He did end up cutting the price a little, but he also said that they would not be doing any more work for us, so I know he was pretty angry. This was clearly a significant miscommunication that was quite upsetting for both parties. And I think I learned my lesson to always get estimates in writing! But was I wrong to ask for a discount at all? It really gave me pause when he said I had insulted him because that was definitely not my intention.  I would really appreciate some perspective on this, please and thank you!",470,"not the asshole.  A real contractor that is on the level would give the quote with the manpower included.

We’ve both been traveling for work a lot in the past 2 months, on different schedules. There’s a huge to-do list I have of things that need to be done, things like there being no clean laundry and lots of expired food. I was explicitly clear that the piles of stuff on the dining room table I was going through, so I had it all organized in specific piles and I had already spent a lot of time on this, so I really made it clear that I didn’t want anything on the table to be touched. This is a formal dining room and this table and is not where we ever eat. It’s always been for projects and stuff.  He got home a few hours before I did tonight. He didn’t do a single thing on the list besides shove everything from the table into garbage bags and put move it all to random places around the house. He didn’t do this sarcastically or to be mean, he “thought I would be happy to see the table cleared off”.

27,"Am I the asshole for not wanting to be a part of my sister’s OCD rituals? So my (17) older sister (23) has OCD, which comes with nighttime rituals which she must complete before she can go to bed. For context, she’s never trusted me because I used to be a pathological liar as a child and she’s the type who NEVER changes her mind about someone once she’s made it up.   Anyway, this situation has been bothering me for a few weeks now. It was a Saturday night and I was supposed to go upstairs at midnight (a rule dictated and enforced only by my sister). Midnight was only a few minutes away, and I was working on a project for school that I wanted to submit by then. It wasn’t due or anything, but I just wanted it over with. Anyway, my sister comes downstairs to make sure I go to bed and she asks me if I brushed my teeth. I hadn’t yet, but I said yes because I knew if I said no, she’d force me to go brush my teeth right then and there while she watched and I wouldn’t be able to submit my project. I probably could have told her that, but she was already snapping at me, and I freeze up whenever she’s like that.   She said she didn’t believe I had brushed my teeth, so I stupidly told her to check. She did. She came back with my toothbrush and screamed at me for ten minutes about how she’ll never trust me again and how she should have known I would lie to her, and then, as predicted, forced me to brush my teeth.   Later, we were talking with a friend of ours and my sister brought it up laughingly. “Oh, my sister got so mad a week or two ago because she didn’t brush her teeth after I told her to. She lied to me, you know. She knows it’s a part of my nighttime ritual that she has to brush her teeth, *there’s nothing I can do about it.*”   I had no idea that I factored so heavily into her rituals, but it left me with a- no pun intended- bad taste in my mouth. How am I supposed to have any semblance of personal freedom if I can’t even forget to brush my teeth without sending her into an OCD meltdown? I know that people with OCD have little control over their particular obsessions and compulsions, but I really, really strongly feel like she needs to have another coping mechanism if her rituals start to involve forcing other people to do things. I don’t mind if she needs me to wash my hands before I touch something of hers or if she needs me to open doors for her, etc etc, but when it comes to her NEEDING me to go to bed EXACTLY at X PM or NEEDING to know that I’ve brushed my teeth before she can even think of going to bed, I think it’s out of line. It’s stressing me out a lot bc a) I don’t want to send her into a downward spiral but b) I can’t keep living like this with my own personal crap being at her beck and call.   I would appreciate input from people who either have OCD or live with people who have OCD, since it’s such a commonly misunderstood disorder.",574,"not the asshole Have ocd, ideally you should not be part of her rituals- **it's not actually helping her in the long run**, but I'm not sure if stopping suddenly would be the best idea, you should try to ask a proffesional about this.

28,"Would I be the asshole for saying something to my friend/coworker about trying to feed me? Bit of background - she (29F) used to work with my husband. They were more friends than her and I were, but we would occasionally go out to lunch and hang out. I always saw her as quirky, but nice.   She lost her job and I know that she is a very dedicated and loyal worker, so I felt comfortable recommending her to work where I do.   Now that we spend more time together, I'm quickly realizing she is generally annoying. She has a lot of habits that annoy many people (mainly that she talks incessantly and doesn't take a hint that you don't want to talk), but she is nice and means well.  One thing in particular, however, drives me so nuts that I might just say something. She will always try to feed me (and everyone really) but she will not take no for an answer.

Her: Are you sure?  Me: Yes.  She then asked me again if I wanted it before she left. She does this all the time with candy, snacks, lunch, etc. and doesn't seem to take a hint.

He said the owner had seen her lift a few small things over the past two years, like makeup or candy and things, and this time he finally caught her in the act.   Thankfully owners not pressing charges but banned her and us from his store, which is whatever since I never shop there anyways. So my husband and I give her a reprimand. She cries and apologizes and I’m like good. You’ve learned your lesson. This is over.   Well my husband REFUSES to let this go. He’s convinced there’s something wrong with her and she needs therapy. I think he’s overreacting. I shoplifted when I was a dumb teenager too although no one ever caught me. In fact everyone I grew up with stole something at one point or another. It’s part of being a teenager. It doesn’t mean you’re going to live a life of crime. It’s. Just. Being. A. Teenager.   However my husband grew up incredibly sheltered and privileged and I’m sure in his circles no one ever nabbed a lip balm from a corner store. I tell him it’s enough that we’ve grounded her, but he freaks out and thinks we need to find professional help for her “stealing habit.” I finally put my foot down and said no, she’s being a normal kid and as long as she doesn’t do it again and get herself in even more trouble she’ll be fine.

Obviously this has been going on for 2 years. Try therapy in case this behavior turns into something worse.  And IMO you should not dismiss your husband's perspective out of hand.

34,"Am I the asshole for asking my boyfriend to be quiet? My boyfriend is a real chatterbox. Very early on in our relationship I told him (politely) that I couldn’t concentrate while watching tv/films if someone was talking at the same time. I write scripts so dialogue is very important to me.  Recently, we were watching a popular television show from my home country (he is from a different country). Never before has a television show from my country been internationally popular, so maybe I’m being overly sensitive because of this, but I asked him extra-nicely if he would please be quite while it’s on, as it is culturally very important to me and is only on for 20 minutes. If he had to ask a question about it because he doesn’t understand, please just pause it first.  He talked the whole way through it and then called me selfish when I told him to please PLEASE be quiet, just for 20 minutes because I didn’t want to miss any dialogue. He was talking about stuff that wasn’t even to do with the programme. The show is essentially a comedy show but had me in tears because of its portrayal of a tragic terrorist attack that happened in my country when I was a child.  I know this is very minor compared to other people’s issues, but just wanna know of ITA for begging my blabbering bf to be quiet while my show is on.",245,"not the asshole he was being disrespectful. If you said you asked him to get out of the house for three hours I’d say you’re unrealistic, but to be quiet for 20 minutes?",2
35,"Am I the asshole for white lying to my girlfriend about masturbating? Quick backstory : my current girlfriend of 7 months was previously cheated on in her last relationship. She acknowledges that she has current trust issues. My girlfriend sleeps over my place 5 days out of the week.   My girlfriend came back today from a 4 day international vacation trip with her girl best friend. During this period, I masturbated once back here at home. My girlfriend is now back and we're on the couch watching TV. Guy in TV starts watching porn, which prompts my girlfriend to ask me when the last time I masturbated was.  The last time she asked me about masturbating, I gave her an honest answer, and she got very upset. I don't see much of a problem with masturbating. We've had a lot of small arguments recently, so part of what we agreed on when we made up is that she'd work on the way she reacts to hurtful truths, as she normally shuts down and stops communicating.   As my girlfriend asks me when the last time I masturbated was, I white-lied and told her it's been a while. As she persists with her questioning, I say that it's been a few weeks. A bit more questioning and I reveal it's actually only been this weekend. I then sincerely apologize profusely about lying, explaining that I was wary of how she'd react, based on her previous reactions.   girlfriend hates the fact that I lied, and equates it to ""if you lie about this, you can be hiding anything"". She associates white lies to lies with cheating. I try to explain my intentions and my line of thinking, but she's had none of it. She's since left and won't be spending the night.   I understand I'm an asshole for white lying, but in my head she might be over reacting a bit. She's also ignored my apologies. ",322,"not the asshole, also massive red flag. If your girlfriend isn't going to let you masturbate, she's being kind of douchy. Seriously, masturbating is a healthy part of your own sexual life, and she shouldn't be violating that.",2
36,"Am I the asshole for being petty about paying for coworkers meal I work in a specialized department at my company with a slightly small group of people.    Usually some of us grab coffee together in the mornings.  Now we are all paid very well to begin with, but under certain circumstances, some of us are given a bonus (20%) for a day or multiple days at a time.    Generally, the guys getting the bonus will pay for the other guys breakfast (5-7 dollars).  I've paid for breakfast multiple times for one person, we'll call him Phil, wether I'm getting the daily bonus or not as sometimes it's easier.  Say the waitress forgets to split the check, I'll just take it and pay for Phil instead of asking her to redo it. Phil does not do this.  He will make the waitress redo the check.   Phil, although he regularly gets the bonus, has never offered to pay.  I'm found out from other people in the department, that Phil is known for always accepting the free breakfast, but never reciprocating.  One time I paid on my way out, and he didn't even feel inclined to leave a tip.  Luckily the other person I paid for, took care of it.     Personally, I don't care.  I buy for someone to be nice, and usually decline if people try to purchase for me, but he's never even thanked me for buying.   Recently we were out, and all the guys getting the daily bonus asked for combined checks.  Then it got to us, and Phil asked for individual checks.   I interrupted and said ""No, one check is fine, I don't want him to struggle paying the mortgage this month.""  Now, most people in the department loved my response, but I'm hearing a few guys think it was rude.  I think it was perfectly acceptable. So what say you reddit, Am I the asshole?    Edited for Info  1. It is absolutely not a money issue.    2. He's done this his entire career.   3. You don't understand the context of it, but people who received the bonus, usually pay for the other guy for a reason.  They are not required to, but it's considered polite to do so.  4. My bigger issue is the Never saying thank you, and going out of his way to split the check when it's possible he'll have to pay.   5. I did stop buying for him, but this particular situation made me want to, just out of spite.",417,"you are the asshole, but not for being upset with your coworker for not reciprocating. It’s the way you went about it. Just stop paying for that coworkers meals since it obviously bothers you. If they don’t want to be part of the meal buying rotation then that’s fine, but don’t go around making petty comments. Be straight out with it.",2
37,"Am I the asshole If I called my girlfriend's friend not very smart to base opinions on anecdotes ? My girlfriend (19F), her friend (20F) , her boyfriend (21M), and I (22M) went to a cafe to catch up. One of the topics was the other couples long-ish trip to Amsterdam. One of the topics was comparing the weather in London (where all of us are based in, neither of us born or raised there though) and Amsterdam. My girlfriend's friend couldn't stop talking about how Amsterdam weather is much better (much less rain, sunnier) than that of London. Now, I have been in Amsterdam on several occasions and it seems to be the same. But I wouldn't base it on my opinion even though it is much more experienced than hers. Instead, I look up (on my phone) verified meteorological statistical data that goes back 10 years and has prediction for the next 10. On temperature/ chance of precipitation/ amount of rainfall London appears to me on average much better to live throughout the year. I mentioned this and told her it is not very smart to base opinions like that on anecdotes, personal or not, because it could be misleading. I further gave an example how last summer was scolding hot in London and most of the UK because of a rare heathwave which is not even remotely close to the average/standard.     Her expression changed so fast and she started throwing a tantrum that I called her stupid etc and saying that I am some educational elitist (my education does have a statistical/scientific component) and that only my opinion matters. Meanwhile, I simply wanted to point this out because going by this in life when useful data is available is a simpleton thing to do and can hurt you lol. My girlfriend is on her side and says I was an ass.     Mixed feelings TBH but I have a hard time understanding why people don't have a grasp of these things.",331,you are the asshole. It was a casual conversation about the weather. You were being patronising. Nobody cares about your statistics.,3
38,"Would I be the asshole If I called a meeting with my boss over a colleagues behavior? I (25F) work for a relatively small company, most of my coworkers are 40-60 year old men with the exception of one recent hire (25M). One of my colleagues (58M) has taken a very vocal disliking to our new hire. He will walk around the office referring to him as “that fucker, mr. Stinky, idiot, etc.”. Last week I told him this was unacceptable (as he’d typically come interrupt my work to voice his complaints) and that if he has a problem he needs to express it to one of our superiors. He claims since I am the admin that’s my job. Note I am an “operations and business development admin”, so I don’t really feel it’s my place or my job to handle office relations. I’ve spoken to my boss before about possibly taking on a more HR type role, and was told we don’t need HR.   Since my telling him that I am no the person he needs to voice his concerns to and that I can’t do anything, he has become irritated with me. I was on the phone with a customer today and he walked up to my desk and started kicking some boxes around and making general disgruntled comments. I put the call on hold and said “do you mind?” To which he said “well guess we’re back to things last week then.” He a few hours later stormed out of the office and ignored my asking if he’s leaving for the day.   Would I be the asshole if I call a meeting with my boss to discuss his behavior? He’s turning the office into a truly unpleasant place to be.",293,I've never been in a workplace where that kind of behaviour would be tolerated. He should be fired.

39,"Am I the asshole for accepting a promotion while knowing that I am leaving in 3 months? Obligatory on mobile, I apologize for any grammar, formatting or spelling errors.  I (23F) graduated in May of 2018 and wanted to spend a few years working before heading to law school to save money and gain experience. I found a great position that I love a lot. My company knows that law school is something I want to do in the future, just not immediately.  I very recently found out that my dad is sick, and the long-term prognosis isnt looking too great. I decided to attend school this fall while I still have the support of both of my parents. This is sooner than I anticipated, but I want my dad to see me graduate. I applied and got a great scholarship to a good law school.  However, I just found out that my manager is leaving the company and I am being promoted to a higher position. Her departure is pretty big for my company, so there is a lot expected from me. I'm excited to take on more responsibility (and get paid more). But now I'm leaving in August and my company has no idea, and I feel bad for leaving so soon.

40,"Am I the asshole for firing a colleague with PTSD? I have PTSD (combat/kinetic-situation based/caused), so I'm familiar with all the lovely issues that go hand-in-hand with it, like shakes, stress, panic attacks, unexpectedly re-living a situation, etc.; good times. I've also spent 8 years getting past it to the best of my abilities, and laying off of self-medication to ""cope"" with it (i.e. booze).  &amp;#x200B;  As of a couple years ago, I'm finally in a good point in my life (engaged, steady senior/high-paying job, house is paid off, and so on). I'm climbing the corporate ladder in a fortune 500 engineering firm, and have finally reached the point where I'm allowed/required to hand off any/all non-leadership/non-engineering work to HR. Each engineering ""fellow"" typically has 1-2 ladies from HR that handle our individual schedules, e-mail/calendar delegation, etc.; for the sake of consistency. Fellows and management are discouraged from asking someone else's HR assistant for help unless his own staff is on vacation for more than 3 days, to avoid over-working or stressing out HR staff (especially the helpful/competent ones, which people tend to take for granted).  &amp;#x200B;  One of my HR assistants has been on sick leave for 3 weeks (plus several more) to visit sick parents overseas, and recently my other assistant went on parental leave (which the team celebrated and for which we prepared a gift basket of baby clothes plus a car seat). **The replacement (""Tia"") that was recently hired has become a nightmare.** In short, a young, seemingly competent lady, but she can't handle deadlines or stress at all. This would at least be remotely manageable, but two HR members coaching her confided in me that Tia told her colleagues she can't manage working under me, because I remind her of an abusive ex (due to my height, skin color, and muscular build). Within a day, a couple junior HR staff come to me to ask why there are allegations of me abusing ""Tia"" physically. Enough is enough: I call in Tia, and demand a straightforward explanation now. She admits to ""likening"" me to her ex, but ""doesn't think"" she said I was abusive. I have a hard-earned reputation to defend and family to provide for. Tia is fired with cause, and blacklisted from our company and partners.  &amp;#x200B;  Tia is now in the hospital with self-inflicted liver damage, and apparently has a history of PTSD.

As soon as the junior staff heard her allegations, it should have been handled by people with understanding of employment law. Literally the first thing they taught us is that, if a complaint is against you, is that you don't talk to the person directly.  You and your company suck for not handling this appropriately. She sucks for doing it in the first place (even if she has mental health issues).  Honestly, you'll be lucky if this is over. I could easily see a lawyer taking her case and making your life hell.",0

So recently I asked my “best friend” why they don’t invite me to do things anymore. He straight up said it’s because I’m single. He said that no one wants to include me because it’s weird to still be single at our age (were all mid to late 20s) and that having me around messes with the group dynamics.

His mother scheduled a flight for him to go home (we live out of state) between his semesters back when we thought this was only gonna last a few weeks. He also told me he would cancel the flight if the quarantine was still going on (where we are, it is).   Well, 2 weeks before he is supposed to go he tells me he still plans on going. He also said that his mom would be visiting in 2 days. I was in shock, as we talked about this, and he said he would cancel his flight.

43,"Am I the asshole for telling a friend that I wouldn’t date her hypothetically because of her age? I have this friend who I met at my last job.  We got along really well so we stayed friends after I left.  We try to get together once or twice a month.  There was a time when she was pretty blatant about flirting with me, but I wasn’t interested in that and basically just played dumb and oblivious and she stopped eventually.    Lately she’s been having a hard time dating.  It’s been a consistent topic of conversation.  She does online dating and has been getting matched and then ghosted.  I’ve just been trying to be a good friend.  Telling her not to give up, there’s someone out there looking for you too, etc.    We were having a few drinks yesterday afternoon and she brings up her latest bad date.   I think we were both a tiny bit buzzed and she was the mopey kind of buzzed.  She went on about how she doesn’t get what the problem is and then listed off her good qualities.  Then she asked me straight out if I would date her hypothetically.  It was instantly uncomfortable for me.  It brought back the awkward period of time she used to flirt with me.   I just felt like I had to make it clear once and for all that I was not a potential partner.  Like I said I was buzzed and may have taken the hypothetical more to heart than I should have, but I really don’t know given our history.  I just pretty much blurred out an honest answer to her.  I probably wouldn’t date anyone in her age range.  That I want to have a lot of kids one day and not have to rush anything to do so.   I felt like garbage immediately, but at the time I really didn’t want to take it back.  She just made a joke about me being a pig.

48,"Am I the asshole for wortying about my best friend being sexually irresponsible? I (19F) have been worried about my best friend and future roommate (18M) for a while. He, I, and our other best friend (18F) are all college ""gifted kid burnouts"". We were all very accomplished in high school (before we knew each other), but also all miserable and without social lives or romantic/sexual experience. My best friend made up for lost time and has hooked up with 30+ guys in the 7 months we've been in college. I've always had a shame complex about sex myself, which led to me promising to save myself for marriage when I was 14. I only took it seriously for about a year, but because those attitudes are still there and I had no life in high school, I'm still a virgin in every sense of the word.  I don't care if he's promiscuous, but the thing is that he has *no* boundaries whatsoever. He doesn't care whether we're in our dorm rooms, walking down the street, on a public bus- he will tell us all the gory details and not give a damn who hears. I don't have a problem with talking about sex (although there are some things I just don't want to hear), but I do worry that people can hear us in public and we seem classless. Between the hypersexuality and the burnout, being trainwrecks is sort of our ""thing"", and it's made us a joke to some other people (there's a story here, but I don't have the character space to tell it- if necessary, I'll elaborate in the comments). I'm worried that we're combining our worst traits together instead of our best.  However, my main concern is that my friend's behavior is starting to cross the line from scandalous to unsafe. Then again, meeting strangers for sex is kind of unsafe on its own, but on several occasions he's put himself in danger- most notably, he got drunk with a stranger in a city he didn't know and ended up passing out on a train and waking up in a sketchy area. He's told me that he's had sex without a condom a few times, but insists that he only does so with people who are clean and that ""the risk is so low that it doesn't matter"". Whenever I tell him that a few minutes of pleasure isn't worth his life, he tells me that I ""don't understand and never will"". I'm risk-averse, although not as much as I used to be. As I said, I also had some negative attitudes towards sex. I get that he probably thinks my concern comes from that, but it's really not about the sex, it's about the irresponsibility. He doesn't react well to anyone telling him what to do, and I'm not trying to judge him for his lifestyle, I just really don't want to see him get hurt. Am I right?
